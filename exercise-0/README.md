# Accessing Your Cluster
In this section you will access the cluster that has been granted to you. When you filled out the form to get access to a cluster, you were added to Alex Parker's IBM Cloud account and given access to a single cluster. These steps were given on that page, but in case you didn't follow them, here they are again.

## Login to IBM Cloud Account and Access Your Cluster
1. Log in to [this IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources?bss_account=91fceeba285eff9110af2355d0cd5cd3). In the account switcher at the top, you should see that you're targeting Alex Parker's account.
2. Navigate to **Clusters**.
3. Select your cluster. It should be named something like **benchprep-01**.
4. This page has some overview information about your cluster. Look around the various tabs.

You will use this cluster for this lab. Note the name of your cluster.
